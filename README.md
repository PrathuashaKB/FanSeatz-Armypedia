*üéüÔ∏è Get Closer to the Stage ‚Äì Book Now!* 

FanSeatz-Armypedia is a simple, responsive frontend ticket-booking web page developed as part of a Web Development course assignment. This project simulates a basic Ticket Booking System, where users can book seats for a concert ‚Äî for example, a BTS concert ‚Äî and view the ticket details upon submission.The application allows users to enter their credentials through an interactive form and reserve seats online. Though it doesn't include backend functionality, it demonstrates core HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts to build a clean, user-friendly interface that adapts to different screen sizes. Inspired by the fan-centric theme of Armypedia, this project focuses on delivering an engaging and visually appealing layout while emphasizing the fundamentals of responsive design, semantic HTML structure, and client-side validation.
